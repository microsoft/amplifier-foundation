# Shadow Amplifier Behavior
# Amplifier-specific overlay for shadow environments
# INCLUDES the generic shadow bundle, so users only need to include this one behavior
bundle:
  name: behavior-shadow-amplifier
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    Amplifier ecosystem-specific shadow environment support.
    Includes the generic shadow bundle plus Amplifier-specific:
    - shadow-smoke-test agent for Amplifier validation
    - Amplifier testing patterns and examples
    - Pre-configured workflows for testing amplifier-core, amplifier-foundation, etc.

# Include the generic shadow bundle - this brings in shadow-operator and base shadow tool
includes:
  - bundle: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-shadow@main

# Amplifier-specific agents
agents:
  amplifier-smoke-test:
    description: |
      Amplifier-specialized smoke test for shadow environments.
      Extends the generic shadow-smoke-test with Amplifier ecosystem knowledge:
      - Knows about amplifier_core, Session, Coordinator imports
      - Understands provider installation and configuration
      - Tests bundle loading and agent availability
      - Validates amplifier-specific CLI commands
      
      Use AFTER shadow-operator creates an environment to validate Amplifier changes.
      For non-Amplifier projects, use the generic shadow-smoke-test instead.
      
      Returns objective VERDICT: PASS/FAIL with evidence.
